# What is a Framework?

A **framework** is a reusable set of libraries or tools that provides a structure and foundation for developing software applications. It offers pre-written code, components, and best practices, allowing developers to build applications more efficiently and consistently. Frameworks help standardize processes, reduce repetitive tasks, and speed up development by offering solutions to common problems.
